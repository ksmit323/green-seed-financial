- Change the text (stuff like in "Our Mission") to be probably more like the original website. Prob don't wanna over represent.
- Change the Key Feature text in the /services endpoints

- I don't like the way the main image renders.  It's too slow or something.

- Change the Header so that it is always green in the /services endpoints

- Fix link discrepancy between the file names of "for-foreign-buyers" and the actual link.

- Consider mobile friendliness

- Need to connect "Send Messag" and "Schedule Now" calendly

- I don't like how clicking the "Our Mission" link sometimes just abruptly jumps to its part of the page.
